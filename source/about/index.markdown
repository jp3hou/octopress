<p>
  I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Computer Science.
  Naturally, UNC basketball is both near and dear to my heart. Ask me anything about it! I might be able to answer.
</p>

<p>
  As you may have already seen mentioned, I have some experience developing web applications primarily using Ruby on Rails,
  and I am currently working as part of a quickly expanding team at a start-up called Womply in San Francisco.

<p>
  You can probably find me exploring the city, going to the gym, reading, writing, or watching 30 Rock.
