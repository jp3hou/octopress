<p>
  I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Computer Science.
  Naturally, UNC basketball is both near and dear to my heart.
</p>

<p>
  I have experience developing web applications using Ruby on Rails and AngularJS, tested using frameworks including Minitest, Mocha, RSpec, and Jasmine.
  I am currently working as part of a quickly expanding team at a start-up called <a href='http://www.reflektive.com' target='blank'>Reflektive</a> in San Francisco, CA.
  You can contact me or see more about me through one of the links provided at the top right.

  In my spare time you can probably find me exploring the city, going to the gym, reading, writing, or watching 30 Rock.
