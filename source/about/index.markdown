  Hi, I'm Julia Chou. I'm a software engineer currently working at a startup called <a href='http://www.reflektive.com' target='blank'>Reflektive</a> in San Francisco, CA, where we're driving a mission to improve employee performance management.
</p>

<p>
  Since I joined Reflektive in October 2016, I've worked on our Real-Time Feedback, Goals, and Reviews products. Some languages and frameworks I've used at Reflektive include Ruby, Rails, React, and Backbone. We use Postgres as our primary datastore and Heroku and AWS for our hosting services.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I was a software engineer at a startup called <a href='http://www.womply.com' target='blank'>Womply</a>, where I worked on our Insights product using Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, MySQL, and AWS in order to provide small business merchants with data, metrics, and other analytics relevant to their business.
</p>

<p>
  I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a BS in Computer Science, so naturally, UNC basketball is near and dear to my heart.
</p>

<p>
  Some of my hobbies and interests include personal finance and money management, fitness (in particular, weightlifting), nutrition, philosophy, reading, and writing. My personal mission is to continually challenge myself to be the best person that I can be, and I hope to spend the rest of my life pursuing that goal.
</p>
