<p>
  I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Computer Science.
  Naturally, UNC basketball is both near and dear to my heart. Ask me anything about it! I might be able to answer.
</p>

<p>
  I have some experience developing web applications using Ruby on Rails and AngularJS, tested using frameworks including
  Capybara, Protractor, RSpec, and Jasmine.
  I am currently working as part of a quickly expanding team at a start-up called Womply in San Francisco, CA. 
  <a href='http://www.womply.com' target='blank'>Womply</a> is a company dedicated to creating solutions to help business merchants
  optimize their operations. The engineering team currently runs under Scrum and Agile principles in 2 week 
  sprints, incorporating regular standups, retrospectives, and scoring meetings.
  You can contact me or see more about me through one of the links provided at the top right.

<p>
  In my spare time you can probably find me exploring the city, going to the gym, reading, writing, or watching 30 Rock.
  One day I will publish a book and all shall love me and despair.
