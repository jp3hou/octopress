  Hi, I'm Julia Chou.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer currently working on the Internal Tools team at <a href='https://www.coinbase.com/' target='blank'>Coinbase</a> in San Francisco, CA, where we're harnessing blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to build a global, open financial system.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I worked at <a href='https://www.reflektive.com/' target='blank'>Reflektive</a> and <a href='https://www.womply.com/' target='blank'>Womply</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, so naturally, UNC basketball is near and dear to my heart. 🐏🏀
</p>

<p>
  Some of my hobbies and interests include personal finance, fitness, nutrition, reading, and writing. Always looking for ways to be a better person.
